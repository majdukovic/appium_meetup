# Mobile Monday meetup (Introduction to mobile automation with Appium + Python)

Repository for Mobile Monday meetup where I gave talk about automating tests for Android & iOS platform using Appium automation framework and Python programming language.

Presented a couple of scenarios:
  1. Writing first test (logging in and enabling PIN login functionality)

  2. Introducing POM (Page Object Model) design pattern, where pages are represented by a corresponding class and elements are      represented by the variables of the class and all interactions are possible through the methods of the class.
     Test cases are executed by interacting with methods from the above mentioned classes.
     
  3. Introducing BrowserStack (cloud web and mobile testing platform) and running test cases on real devices in the cloud.
